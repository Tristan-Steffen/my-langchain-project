This project has some examples to test langchain. To use it just run "yarn install" and create a .env file.
To copy the .env.example file to .env, you can use the cp command in the terminal or command prompt, depending on your operating system.

On Unix-based systems (like Linux or macOS), use the following command:
"cp .env.example .env"

On Windows, use the following command:
"copy .env.example .env"
